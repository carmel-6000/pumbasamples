Uploading Images/Files to the system
------------------------------


1. Saving the image

We are saving the image inside the save procedure of other models different than "image.js"

The save process takes place into a form for a specific model (e.g: games)

2.
There is a mixin that launches everytime any request takes place on the server : mixin/FilesHandler.js

This mixin's role is to detect if we have inside the data fields any field of type File 

The field type file could be of three diferent types: Audio, Files, Images.

3. If FilesHandler detects any of the three types, example to a data set:

we want to save data set into model :Games
{
	gameName:"best game on earth",
	numOfPlayers:4,
	gameImage:{
		type:"image" (this value is a const!),
		src:"SDFJSDIFJSDFIJWEIFJEWIFJWEFIJEWIJWEFIWEJF (base 64 content for the image)",
	},
	anotherImage:{
		type:"image" (this value is a const!),
		src:"SDFJSDIFJSDFIJWEIFJEWIFJWEFIJEWIJWEFIWEJF (base 64 content for the image)",
		category:"people"
	}
}

If the type is Image, the fileHandler launches image save hook.
common/models/image.js

a. Additional entry will be added to Files/Images models with ownerId (current user id)

b. The image will be saved into /public/images/CATEGORY/[IMAGE_ID].jpg/png/gif

c. in the specific model (in our example it is games), only the relation will be saved, e.g: anotherImage:6
